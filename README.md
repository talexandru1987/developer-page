# Developer's page

Let's go back in time before JavaScirpt was born :). This an intro page for me as a programmer. I wanted to create something simple so I used only html and css.



## Usage

 Just navigate to [this](https://talexandru1987.github.io/developer-page/) page and have look. Hope you like it!
